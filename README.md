#Sass Test Project

Wanted to try and create a project using [**Compass**](http://compass-style.org/) for a lot of the @includes and mixins with my **Sass** code. The page looks terrible but I was able to get the code to work. I'm very happy with the results since I now feel like I have a handle on how to import and use **Compass** with future projects.
